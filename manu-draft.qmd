## Methods

### Data processing

Salinity gaps were filled using linear interpolation between observed values, where the maximum gap fill was three time steps (months).  Gaps accounted for less than 5% of the observatiosn for each bay segment.  

### GAMs

$$
\begin{align}
\text{chla}_i &\sim \text{Gamma}(\mu_i, \phi) \\
\log(\mu_i) &= \beta_0 + f_1(\text{dec\_time}_i) + f_2(\text{doy}_i) + f_3(\text{sal}_i) \\
&\quad + f_{12}(\text{dec\_time}_i, \text{doy}_i) \\
&\quad + f_{13}(\text{dec\_time}_i, \text{sal}_i) \\
&\quad + f_{23}(\text{sal}_i, \text{doy}_i)
\end{align}
$$

where chlorophyll-a is modelled as a Gamma-distributed response variable with mean $\mu_i$ and dispersion parameter ϕ for observation i.  The log-transformed mean chlorophyll-a is modelled as an intercept ($\beta_0$) plus smooth functions of decimal time (dec_time), day of year (doy), and salinity (sal), along with tensor product smooth interactions between each pair of the three predictors.  Specifically, $f_1​(\cdot)$ is a thin plate regression spline with k = 40 basis functions, $f_2(\cdot)$ is a cyclic cubic regression spline with k = 10 basis functions, $f_3(\cdot)$ is a thin plate regression spline with k = 10 basis functions, and $f_{12}(\cdot, \cdot)$, $f_{13}(\cdot, \cdot)$, and $f_{23}(\cdot, \cdot)$ are tensor product smooths (excluding main effects) with k = (5, 5) basis functions.  Smoothing parameters were estimated using restricted maximum likelihood (REML).

ACF plots showed minimal autocorrelation of model residuals at lag 1 (all < 0.20 rho).

K values chosen to allow sufficient degress of freedom for each smoother.  Once models were fit, the `gam.check()` function was used to compare the estimated degrees of freedom for each smoother to the maximum degrees of freedom allowed by the k value.  None of the smoothers were within 80% of the maximum degrees of freedom allowed. 

Salinity-normalized predictions were made by predicting chlorophyll-a across a range of salinity values (minimum to maximum observed) at each time step, then taking the mean of those predictions as the salinity-normalized value for that time step.  

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Norm}(t) &= \frac{1}{|\mathcal{S}|} \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}} \hat{f}\left(t, s, \bar{\text{sal}}_{m(t),y(t)}\right)
\end{align}

Facets are arranged to show how the monthly predictions vary across years and different salnity ranges.  The points show the model predicted results for the observed salinity.  Salinity ranges in each plot are fixed the minimum and maximum observed across years for the month.

GAM-predicted chlorophyll-a (points) and salinity-normalized (lines) are shown for each quarter (a), followed by hydrologic load anomalies (10$^6$ m$^3$ / quarter) as the load minus the long-term average by quarter (b), followed by the relationship between the predicted minus salinity-normalized chlorophyll and the hydrologic load anomalies by quarter (c).
